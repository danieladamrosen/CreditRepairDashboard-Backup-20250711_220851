# Restore Point: Pink Styling for Status-Changed Accounts
**Created:** June 22, 2025 at 3:59 PM
**Status:** Complete Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented pink styling (bg-red-50) for positive/closed accounts when their status is changed to "Negative" via dropdown selection. This provides visual consistency with other negative items while enabling full dispute functionality.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Account Row Component Updates
- **File:** `client/src/components/credit-report/account-row.tsx`
- **Added:** Status change detection logic
- **Added:** Pink styling for originally positive accounts changed to negative
- **Updated:** Card-level and bureau-level styling logic

### 2. Implementation Details

#### Status Change Detection
```typescript
// Track if any positive/closed account has been changed to negative
const hasStatusChanged = (originallyNegative: boolean, currentStatus: string) => {
  return !originallyNegative && currentStatus === 'Negative';
};

// Check if any bureau status has been changed to negative for originally positive/closed accounts
const hasPositiveChangedToNegative = 
  hasStatusChanged(accountIsNegative, transUnionStatus) ||
  hasStatusChanged(accountIsNegative, equifaxStatus) ||
  hasStatusChanged(accountIsNegative, experianStatus);
```

#### Card-Level Styling
```typescript
border ${
  isDisputeSaved
    ? 'border-3 border-green-300 bg-green-50'
    : hasPositiveChangedToNegative
      ? 'border-red-200 bg-red-50'
      : hasAnyNegative
        ? 'border-red-200 bg-red-50'
        : 'border-gray-200 bg-white'
}
```

#### Bureau-Level Styling
Applied to all three bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax, Experian):
```typescript
className={`border rounded-lg p-4 ${
  isDisputeSaved
    ? 'border-3 border-green-500 bg-green-50'
    : (status || (accountIsNegative ? 'Negative' : 'Positive')) === 'Negative'
      ? hasStatusChanged(accountIsNegative, status)
        ? 'border-3 border-red-500 bg-red-50'
        : 'border-3 border-red-500 bg-white'
      : 'border-gray-200 bg-gray-50'
}`}
```

### 3. Color Correction
- **Fixed:** Initially used incorrect `bg-pink-50`
- **Corrected:** To proper `bg-red-50` matching other sections
- **Consistency:** Maintains visual harmony across all negative items

## Functionality Added

### 1. Visual Feedback
- Positive/closed accounts turn pink when status changed to "Negative"
- Maintains red border styling consistent with negative items
- Green styling when disputes are saved
- Gray styling for unchanged positive accounts

### 2. Dispute Functionality
- Full dispute workflow enabled for status-changed accounts
- Same functionality as originally negative accounts
- AI auto-typing and violation detection
- Complete save and collapse choreography

### 3. State Management
- Tracks original account negativity status
- Monitors dropdown status changes per bureau
- Enables mixed states (some bureaus negative, others positive)

## Testing Verified
- [x] Positive accounts display normally (gray background)
- [x] Changing status to "Negative" applies pink background (bg-red-50)
- [x] Individual bureau boxes also turn pink when changed to negative
- [x] Dispute functionality works for status-changed accounts
- [x] Visual consistency maintained across all sections
- [x] Color matches other pink sections in application
